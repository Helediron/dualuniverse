#Customize MyDU item hierarchy.

**This is a test. There is no guarantee that this works.**

The script changes values in the item hierarchy. It takes a default export from backoffice, modifies it and writes out the modified version.

Read the script. Each modify line changes one value in the item hierarchy.

- Click Item Hierarchy in backoffice.
- Click Download on top. Save the items.yaml file next to the script.
- Run the script.
- Select the items-changed.yaml in backoffice on top and click Update from File.
