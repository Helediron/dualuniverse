A Dual Universe program which calculates coordinates of a hex.

Usage:
```sh
python territoryid.py territories hexid
```
where territories is number of territories on a planet.
hexid is territory id number. You can enter multiple hexids. Leaving out the id prints all hexes.

E.g. on Alioth to find Market 6 hex:
```sh
python .\territoryID.py 259472 31644
31644 36.14 101.45
```
The output is hexid latitude longitude. Note that coordinates are not exactly same as in Dual Universe.
